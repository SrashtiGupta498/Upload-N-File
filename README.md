## 📦 Bulk Data CRUD API – RESTful Web Application
This project is a backend web application designed to handle **bulk CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)** operations efficiently using **REST APIs**. The system is built for scalability and is suitable for managing large volumes of data in enterprise or production environments.
### 🔧 Core Functionality
* **Bulk Insert**: Add multiple records in a single API call to save time and reduce overhead.
* **Bulk Fetch**: Retrieve large datasets quickly with support for filtering and pagination.
* **Bulk Update**: Modify multiple records simultaneously based on specified conditions.
* **Bulk Delete**: Remove multiple entries in one go, either by IDs or custom filters.
### 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Backend Language**: Node.js with Express.js (or any other suitable backend framework)
* **Database**: MongoDB (NoSQL) or SQL alternative (e.g., PostgreSQL) depending on requirement
* **API Style**: RESTful APIs with structured and standardized endpoints
* **Tools for Testing**: Postman or any REST client for validating endpoints
### 🌐 Use Cases
* Admin panels or dashboards that need to manage a large volume of records
* Data migration tools
* Batch processing services
* Internal data handling tools for CRM, Inventory, or Analytics platforms
### ✅ Benefits
* **Improved Performance**: Handles multiple records in one request, reducing network latency.
* **Ease of Integration**: Can be easily connected with frontend frameworks or external services.
* **Scalable Architecture**: Built to support large-scale data operations with robust error handling and validations.
### 📁 Folder Structure Overview
* `controllers/` – Handles business logic for CRUD operations
* `routes/` – Defines REST API endpoints
* `models/` – Database schema or data model definitions
* `config/` – Database and environment configuration files
* `server.js` – Main entry point of the application
### 🧑‍💻 Deployment & Setup
1. Clone the repository.
2. Configure your environment variables (e.g., database URI).
3. Install dependencies and start the server.
4. Use a REST client to interact with the APIs for bulk operations.
